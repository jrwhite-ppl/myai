## Implementation Status (As of 2025-08-19)

### âœ… Completed Phases
- **Phase 1-7**: All core functionality implemented
- **Claude Integration**: Working with `~/.claude` path
- **Cursor Integration**: Project-level only (`.cursor/rules/` directory with .mdc files)
- **Default Agents**: 23 rich agents in various categories
- **Setup Commands**:
  - `myai setup all-setup`: Comprehensive setup with Agent-OS integration
  - `myai setup uninstall`: Surgical removal that preserves user files
- **Testing**: 768 tests passing with `make pre-ci`

### ðŸš§ Remaining Phases
- **Phase 8**: Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Phase 9**: Documentation and Polish
- **Phase 10**: Additional Core Features
- **Phase 11**: Advanced System Features
- **Phase 12**: Release Preparation
- **Phase 13**: Migration and Rollback Systems
- **Phase 14**: Community and Extension Features
- **Phase 15**: Performance and Monitoring

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Typer + Rich**: Modern CLI framework with beautiful output
2. **Hierarchical Configuration**: Flexible system supporting multiple contexts
3. **Agent-OS Integration**: Hidden dependency providing proven patterns
4. **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin system for future tools
5. **Security First**: Secure defaults and practices throughout

## Directory Structure

The implementation will follow this structure:

```
myai/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ myai/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ cli/             # CLI commands
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ config/          # Configuration management
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ agents/          # Agent management
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ integrations/    # Tool adapters
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ agent_os/        # Agent-OS integration
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ data/            # Default agents and configs
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â””â”€â”€ scripts/
```

## Next Steps

1. Set up the basic project structure
2. Implement core CLI framework
3. Build configuration management
4. Add agent discovery and management
5. Implement tool integrations
6. Add interactive features
7. Comprehensive testing
8. Documentation and release

These specifications provide a complete blueprint for building MyAI. Each document contains detailed implementation guidance while maintaining flexibility for adjustments during development.
