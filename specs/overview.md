# MyAI CLI Tool - Project Overview

## Vision

MyAI is a unified command-line interface tool designed to centralize and streamline AI configuration management across multiple AI-powered development tools. It serves as a single source of truth for managing AI assistant configurations, agents, and integrations while maintaining compatibility with existing tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and future AI development assistants.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Centralized Configuration Management
- Establish `~/.myai` as the primary configuration hub
- Support hierarchical configuration layers: Enterprise → User → Team → Project
- Enable seamless configuration sharing and inheritance
- Provide both nuclear (complete override) and merge (incremental) update modes

### 2. Seamless Agent-OS Integration
- Integrate transparently with the Agent-OS methodology
- Maintain compatibility with existing Agent-OS workflows
- Hide complexity from end users while leveraging Agent-OS capabilities
- Support Agent-OS directory structures and standards

### 3. Multi-Tool AI Assistant Support
- Primary support for Claude Code and Cursor
- Extensible architecture for future AI tools
- Configuration redirection to maintain single source of truth
- Tool-specific customization while maintaining consistency

### 4. Agent Lifecycle Management
- Full CRUD operations for AI agents
- Default agent library based on proven patterns
- Custom agent creation and modification
- Agent discovery and auto-loading mechanisms

## Key Features

### Configuration Management
- **Hierarchical Configuration System**: Support for enterprise, user, team, and project-level configurations
- **Smart Merging**: Intelligent configuration merging with conflict resolution
- **Nuclear Option**: Complete configuration reset capability for troubleshooting
- **Version Control Friendly**: Configuration formats optimized for Git workflows

### Agent Management
- **Agent Registry**: Centralized registry of available agents
- **Custom Agents**: User-defined agents with full specification control
- **Agent Templates**: Pre-built agent templates for common roles
- **Agent Versioning**: Track and manage agent specification versions

### Tool Integration
- **Claude Code Integration**: Automatic configuration syncing with Claude Code
- **Cursor Integration**: Rule generation and management for Cursor
- **Extensible Framework**: Plugin-based architecture for new tools
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain existing tool configurations

### Developer Experience
- **Simple CLI Interface**: Intuitive Typer-based command structure
- **Rich Output**: Beautiful terminal output with Rich library
- **Interactive Modes**: Guided setup and configuration wizards
- **Comprehensive Help**: Context-aware help and documentation

## User Experience Principles

### 1. Transparency Without Complexity
Users should benefit from Agent-OS integration without needing to understand its internals. The tool should "just work" while providing power users with advanced options.

### 2. Safety First
All destructive operations require explicit confirmation. The tool maintains backups before major changes and provides rollback capabilities.

### 3. Convention Over Configuration
Sensible defaults that work out-of-the-box. Users should only need to configure what differs from the defaults.

### 4. Progressive Disclosure
Basic users see simple commands and options. Advanced features are available but not overwhelming to newcomers.

### 5. Consistency Across Tools
Uniform experience whether configuring Claude Code, Cursor, or future tools. Learn once, apply everywhere.

## Success Metrics

1. **Adoption Rate**: Percentage of AI tool users adopting MyAI for configuration management
2. **Configuration Consistency**: Reduction in configuration drift across tools
3. **Time to Productivity**: Decreased setup time for new projects and team members
4. **Agent Utilization**: Increased usage of specialized agents for development tasks
5. **Tool Integration Coverage**: Number of AI tools supported by the platform

## Non-Goals

1. **Not a Replacement**: MyAI complements, not replaces, existing AI tools
2. **Not an AI Runtime**: MyAI manages configurations, not agent execution
3. **Not a Version Control System**: Works with, not replaces, Git
4. **Not a Security Layer**: Relies on underlying tool security models

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- Software developers using AI-assisted development tools
- Development teams standardizing AI tool configurations
- DevOps engineers managing AI tool deployments
- Technical leads establishing team standards

### Secondary Users
- Enterprise IT departments managing AI tool policies
- Open source contributors sharing agent configurations
- AI tool vendors seeking configuration standards
- Training organizations teaching AI-assisted development

## Integration Philosophy

MyAI acts as a configuration orchestrator, not a configuration enforcer. It respects existing tool boundaries while providing a unified management layer. The tool should feel like a natural extension of the developer's workflow, not an additional layer of complexity.

## Future Vision

As AI-assisted development tools proliferate, MyAI will evolve to:
- Support emerging AI development tools
- Enable cross-tool agent sharing and communication
- Provide configuration analytics and optimization
- Facilitate community-driven agent marketplace
- Integrate with enterprise configuration management systems

The ultimate goal is to make AI tool configuration as simple and standardized as package management has become for dependencies.
