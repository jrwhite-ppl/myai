# MyAI Implementation Tasks

## Current Status (Updated: 2025-08-22)

### CLI User Experience Review (2025-08-22)
Based on comprehensive user testing, the following improvements have been identified:

#### General Patterns
- **Help Documentation**: All commands need expanded help text with:
  - Clear explanation of what the command does
  - When and why to use it
  - Expected outcomes
  - Examples of common usage
  - Related commands
  - Domain concept explanations

- **Command Feedback**: All commands need more informative output:
  - What was done (created, updated, skipped)
  - Where files/changes are located
  - What the action means in practical terms
  - Next steps or related commands

#### Specific Command Issues

**1. `myai version`**
- Works well, already has `--short` flag
- Consider adding version source/origin info

**2. `myai status`**
- Add actionable hints for "Not Set" items
- Clarify what "Integration" means
- Add "Next Steps" section when unconfigured
- Location: `/src/myai/app.py` lines 79-206

**3. `myai install all`**
- Add status indicators (created vs exists)
- Add contextual descriptions in gray text
- Show summary of what was installed/updated
- Location: `/src/myai/commands/install_cli.py`

**4. `myai agent show <name>`**
- Add agent content preview box
- Consider `--full` flag for complete content
- Location: `/src/myai/commands/agent_cli.py`

**5. `myai agent create`**
- Better ANTHROPIC_API_KEY error handling (guide setup)
- Add verbose feedback during creation
- Show post-creation options
- Location: `/src/myai/commands/agent_cli.py`

**6. `myai agent enable/disable`**
- Explain what enabling/disabling does
- Show what files were created/removed
- Provide next steps
- Location: `/src/myai/commands/agent_cli.py`

**7. `myai agent edit`**
- Add context header (file location, agent name)
- Show agent metadata before editing
- Location: `/src/myai/commands/agent_cli.py`

**8. `myai agent validate`**
- Show what was validated and against what
- List specific checks performed
- Add validation criteria explanation
- Location: `/src/myai/commands/agent_cli.py`

**9. `myai agent test`**
- Better ANTHROPIC_API_KEY error handling
- Show detailed progress and file locations
- Location: `/src/myai/commands/agent_cli.py`

**10. `myai agent diff`**
- Better error handling with suggestions
- Add visual diff with colors
- Add text-only option
- Location: `/src/myai/commands/agent_cli.py`

**11. `myai config get`**

- List validation rules applied
- Show detailed results
- Location: `/src/myai/commands/config_cli.py`

**14. `myai system integration-list`**
- Add descriptions for each integration
- Explain what's being checked
- Add installation instructions if not available
- Consider merging with integration-health
- Location: `/src/myai/commands/system_cli.py`

**15. `myai system integration-import`**
- Clarify purpose and expected outcome
- Show detailed scan results
- Explain why no agents were found
- Location: `/src/myai/commands/system_cli.py`

## Current Status (Updated: 2025-08-19)

### Recent Updates
- Fixed Claude integration to use `~/.claude` path as specified
- Updated Cursor integration to project-level only (no global rules)
- Fixed agent loading to use rich default agents from `src/myai/data/agents/default/`
- Implemented comprehensive `myai setup all-setup` command with Agent-OS integration
- Implemented surgical `myai setup uninstall` that preserves user files
- All tests passing (768 tests) with `make pre-ci`

### Key Commands Implemented
- **`myai setup all-setup`**: Comprehensive setup that:
  - Sets up global `~/.myai` directory with Agent-OS components
  - Creates and configures `~/.claude` directory with agents
  - Creates project-level `.claude/agents` directory with local agent copies
  - Creates project-level `.cursor/rules` directory with .mdc files
  - Syncs all agents to both Claude and Cursor integrations
- **`myai setup uninstall`**: Surgical removal that:
  - Only removes MyAI-created files (preserves user files)
  - Supports selective removal with flags: `--global-agents`, `--global-config`, `--claude`, `--project`, `--all`
  - Cleans up empty directories after file removal
  - Works for both global and project-level directories
