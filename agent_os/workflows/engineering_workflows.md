# Engineering Team Workflows

## Architecture Review Workflow

### System Design Review Process
1. **Requirements Analysis** (Systems Architect)
   - Functional and non-functional requirements gathering
   - Stakeholder constraint identification
   - Performance and scalability targets definition
   - Security and compliance requirements assessment

2. **Architecture Design** (Systems Architect)
   - Multiple solution option development
   - Trade-off analysis and decision rationale
   - Technology stack selection and justification
   - Integration and dependency mapping

3. **Quality Validation** (QA Engineer)
   - Testability assessment of proposed architecture
   - Performance testing strategy development
   - Quality gate definition and criteria
   - Risk assessment from quality perspective

4. **Implementation Planning**
   - Phased delivery approach
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Success criteria and metrics definition
   - Resource and timeline estimation

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- **Template**: Context, Decision, Status, Consequences
- **Review Cycle**: Quarterly ADR review and validation
- **Update Process**: Changes require new ADR with rationale
- **Documentation**: All decisions tracked and accessible

## Quality Assurance Workflow

### Test Strategy Development
1. **Requirements Analysis** (QA Engineer)
   - Acceptance criteria validation and clarification
   - Risk-based testing prioritization
   - Test coverage analysis and gap identification
   - Performance and security testing requirements

2. **Test Design and Implementation**
   - Test case development and automation strategy
   - Test data management and environment setup
   - Integration with CI/CD pipeline
   - Manual testing procedure documentation

3. **Execution and Validation**
   - Automated test execution and monitoring
   - Manual exploratory testing sessions
   - Performance and load testing execution
   - Security and compliance testing validation

4. **Results Analysis and Reporting**
   - Defect identification and classification
   - Quality metrics collection and analysis
   - Release readiness assessment
   - Continuous improvement recommendations

### Testing Standards
- **Unit Testing**: >90% code coverage requirement
- **Integration Testing**: All API endpoints and data flows
- **End-to-End Testing**: Critical user journeys automated
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for expected + 3x capacity
- **Security Testing**: OWASP Top 10 coverage mandatory

## Cross-Team Collaboration Workflows

### Engineering-Development Integration
1. **Architecture-Implementation Alignment**
   - Regular design review meetings
   - Code review focus on architectural compliance
   - Technical debt assessment and management
   - Performance optimization collaboration

2. **Quality Integration**
   - Shift-left testing implementation
   - Developer testing training and support
   - Quality gate integration in development workflow
   - Automated testing infrastructure management

### Engineering-Security Collaboration
1. **Security Architecture Review**
   - Threat modeling for new systems
   - Security control design and implementation
   - Zero-trust architecture validation
   - Security testing integration

2. **Compliance and Governance**
   - Security requirement integration in architecture
   - Audit support and evidence collection
   - Security monitoring and alerting design
   - Incident response technical support

### Engineering-DevOps Integration
1. **Infrastructure Architecture Alignment**
   - Deployment architecture design
   - Scalability and reliability requirements
   - Monitoring and observability strategy
   - Infrastructure as Code implementation

2. **Operational Excellence**
   - SLA/SLO definition and monitoring
   - Disaster recovery and business continuity
   - Capacity planning and performance optimization
   - Incident response and root cause analysis

## Performance Standards

### Architecture Quality Gates
- **Scalability**: Design supports 10x current load
- **Reliability**: >99.9% uptime design target
- **Security**: Security-by-design principles applied
- **Maintainability**: Clear documentation and modularity
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms API response time design
- **Cost Efficiency**: TCO analysis and optimization

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: >90% automated test coverage
- **Defect Rate**: <2% critical/high severity defects in production
- **Performance**: 95th percentile response times within SLA
- **Security**: Zero high/critical security vulnerabilities
- **Reliability**: <4 hours mean time to recovery (MTTR)

### Review Standards
- **Architecture Reviews**: Monthly for active projects
- **Quality Reviews**: Sprint-based for development projects
- **Performance Reviews**: Quarterly for all systems
- **Security Reviews**: Annual with ad-hoc threat assessments
- **Process Reviews**: Quarterly workflow optimization

## Continuous Improvement Process

### Learning and Development
- **Technology Evaluation**: Quarterly assessment of new technologies
- **Best Practices Sharing**: Monthly engineering knowledge sharing
- **Training Programs**: Skill development and certification support
- **Industry Benchmarking**: Annual comparison with industry standards

### Process Optimization
