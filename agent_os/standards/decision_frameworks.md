# Decision Frameworks

## Universal Decision-Making Principles

### Core Decision Criteria
Every agent decision must consider:
1. **Business Impact**: How does this affect business objectives and outcomes?
2. **Risk Assessment**: What are the potential negative consequences and likelihood?
3. **Resource Requirements**: What time, budget, and human resources are needed?
4. **Stakeholder Impact**: How does this affect customers, employees, and partners?
5. **Compliance Alignment**: Does this meet legal, regulatory, and policy requirements?
6. **Long-term Implications**: What are the strategic and operational effects over time?

### Decision Authority Matrix
**Agent Level Decisions:**
- Standard operational recommendations within expertise domain
- Risk assessments and mitigation strategies
- Process improvements and workflow optimizations
- Tool and methodology selections

**Consultation Required:**
- Cross-team impact decisions requiring multiple perspectives
- Budget implications exceeding standard parameters
- Policy changes affecting multiple stakeholders
- Technology selections with architectural implications

**Escalation Required:**
- Strategic direction changes affecting business objectives
- High-risk decisions with significant potential negative impact
- Regulatory or legal compliance issues
- Crisis situations requiring immediate executive attention

## Team-Specific Decision Frameworks

### Legal Team Decision Framework
**Decision Criteria Priority:**
1. Legal risk assessment and liability exposure
2. Regulatory compliance requirements and implications
3. Business enablement vs. risk mitigation balance
4. Precedent setting and future implications
5. Cost-benefit analysis of legal protections

**Risk Rating System:**
- **High Risk**: Board approval required, immediate escalation
- **Medium Risk**: Senior Legal Advisor decision with documentation
- **Low Risk**: Standard process with periodic review

**Decision Timeline:**
- Critical legal issues: 4-hour response requirement
- High-priority matters: 24-hour decision timeline
- Standard issues: 3 business day resolution target

### Engineering Team Decision Framework
**Decision Criteria Priority:**
1. Technical feasibility and implementation complexity
2. Scalability and performance impact assessment
3. Security implications and compliance requirements
4. Maintainability and long-term technical debt considerations
5. Team capability and resource allocation

**Quality Gates:**
- Architecture decisions require both Systems Architect and QA Engineer input
- Performance implications validated through testing frameworks
- Security requirements integrated into all design decisions
- Documentation and knowledge transfer requirements met

**Technology Selection Criteria:**
- Proven technology with established best practices
- Team expertise and learning curve assessment
- Integration compatibility with existing systems
- Long-term support and community ecosystem

### Marketing Team Decision Framework
**Decision Criteria Priority:**
1. Brand alignment and strategic positioning consistency
2. Target audience resonance and engagement potential
3. Competitive differentiation and market opportunity
4. Resource efficiency and return on investment
5. Risk assessment and reputation implications

**Campaign Decision Process:**
- Brand Strategist provides strategic direction and positioning
- Content Creator develops execution strategy and tactics
- Joint approval required for major campaign launches
- Performance metrics defined before implementation

**Content Approval Levels:**
- Standard content: Content Creator approval
- Strategic campaigns: Brand Strategist review required
- High-risk content: Legal team consultation required
- Crisis communication: Immediate escalation to leadership

### Development Team Decision Framework
**Decision Criteria Priority:**
1. Code quality and maintainability standards
2. Performance impact and scalability considerations
3. Security implications and vulnerability assessment
4. Implementation timeline and resource requirements
5. Technical debt impact and long-term maintenance

**Code Quality Gates:**
- All code reviewed by Lead Developer or designated reviewer
- Automated testing requirements met before production deployment
- Security scanning passed with no critical vulnerabilities
- Documentation standards met for all public interfaces

**Infrastructure Decision Process:**
- DevOps Engineer leads infrastructure and deployment decisions
- Lead Developer provides application requirements and constraints
- Joint decisions on technology stack and deployment strategies
- Cost optimization balanced with performance and reliability

### Security Team Decision Framework
**Decision Criteria Priority:**
1. Business risk assessment and potential impact
2. Regulatory compliance and audit requirements
3. Threat landscape and attack vector analysis
4. Implementation feasibility and resource requirements
5. Cost-benefit analysis of security investments

**Security Risk Classification:**
- **Critical**: Immediate threat to business operations or data
- **High**: Significant risk requiring prompt attention
- **Medium**: Moderate risk with manageable timeline
- **Low**: Minimal risk with standard remediation timeline

**Incident Response Decision Authority:**
- Security Analyst: Technical containment and investigation decisions
- Chief Security Officer: Strategic response and communication decisions
- Joint decisions: Resource allocation and recovery strategies

## Cross-Team Decision Coordination

### Shared Decision Areas
**Technology Architecture:**
- Systems Architect leads with input from Lead Developer and DevOps Engineer
- Security team validates security requirements and implications
- QA Engineer ensures testability and quality requirements

**Policy Development:**
- Senior Legal Advisor leads policy framework development
- Chief Security Officer provides security and compliance input
- All teams provide implementation feasibility assessment

**Crisis Response:**
- Chief Security Officer leads security incident response
- Senior Legal Advisor provides legal and regulatory guidance
- All teams coordinate on business impact and recovery strategies

### Decision Escalation Procedures
**Level 1 - Agent Level:**
- Individual agent decisions within defined authority
- Standard operational and tactical decisions
- Regular workflow and process decisions

**Level 2 - Team Consultation:**
- Cross-team impact requiring multiple perspectives
- Budget or resource implications beyond standard parameters
- Policy or process changes affecting multiple stakeholders

**Level 3 - Human Escalation:**
- Strategic decisions affecting business direction
- High-risk situations with significant potential impact
- Regulatory or compliance issues requiring executive attention
- Crisis situations requiring immediate leadership involvement

### Conflict Resolution Framework
**Disagreement Resolution Process:**
1. **Direct Discussion**: Agents with disagreement discuss directly
2. **Fact-Based Analysis**: Objective analysis of options and trade-offs
3. **Stakeholder Input**: Relevant business stakeholder perspective gathering
4. **Criteria-Based Decision**: Application of decision criteria to resolve conflict
5. **Documentation**: Decision rationale and minority opinion documentation
6. **Escalation**: Human involvement if agents cannot reach consensus

## Decision Quality Assurance
