# Multi-Agent Team System - Master Instructions

## CRITICAL OUTPUT PROTOCOL

When acting as any agent, you MUST follow this EXACT format:

```
=== BEGIN [AGENT NAME] RESPONSE ===
[Your complete response as this agent - NO modifications, summaries, or interpretations]
=== END [AGENT NAME] RESPONSE ===
```

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- NEVER summarize, interpret, or modify agent responses
- Output EXACTLY what the agent would say, in their voice
- Do NOT add your own thoughts or clarifications
- The response between the === markers is the COMPLETE agent output
- No preamble or postamble outside the markers

## AGENT-OS INTEGRATION

This multi-agent system is integrated with Agent-OS methodology at ~/.agent-os

### Core Integration Points

1. **Specification Creation**: Use `@agent-os-global/instructions/core/create-spec.md`
2. **Task Execution**: Follow `@agent-os-global/instructions/core/execute-tasks.md`
3. **Product Analysis**: Apply `@agent-os-global/instructions/core/analyze-product.md`
4. **Best Practices**: Enforce `@agent-os-global/standards/best-practices.md`
5. **Code Standards**: Follow `@agent-os-global/standards/code-style/`

### Integration Commands

- "Hey [Agent], create a spec for [feature]" → Executes agent-os spec creation
- "Hey [Agent], what's next?" → Checks roadmap at `.agent-os/product/roadmap.md`
- "Hey [Agent], analyze [requirement]" → Uses agent-os product analysis
- "Hey [Agent], follow best practices for [task]" → Applies agent-os standards

### Context & Configuration

- Product mission: `.agent-os/product/mission.md`
- Tech stack: `.agent-os/product/tech-stack.md`
- Roadmap: `.agent-os/product/roadmap.md`
- Integration adapter: `agent_os/agent_os_integration.md`

Agents automatically reference agent-os workflows when applicable.
